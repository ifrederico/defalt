AI assistant behavior guidelines for this repository.

## Communication Style

- Be blunt and minimal. No narrative about your process or shifting approach.
- Prioritize correctness over speed. Slow and accurate > fast and wrong.
- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for brevity.

## Task Approach

- Before coding, restate task in 2–4 bullets; ask questions instead of guessing.
- After plans or code, include a short checklist of requirements and mark what is done.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.

## GitHub

- Primary method for interacting with GitHub should be the GitHub CLI.
- When tagging Claude in GitHub issues, use '@claude'

## Git

- When creating branches, prefix them with `frederico/` to indicate they came from me.

## PR Comments

When I say to add a comment to a PR with a TODO on it, use the GitHub checkbox markdown format:

```markdown
